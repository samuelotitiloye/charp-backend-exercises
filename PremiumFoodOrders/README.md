# Premium Food Orders

This program filters food orders based on their total price and returns a list of premium orders that exceed a given threshold (e.g., $20.00). It uses conditional logic and list filtering to simulate backend reward logic for food vendors.

## Concepts Practiced:
- Lists of custom objects
- Looping through lists
- Conditional filtering with numeric thresholds
- Returning a list of filtered results
- Dynamic method parameterization

## Sample Output:
Premium food orders: ORD004 ORD005

## Next Steps:
- Allow the user to set the threshold at runtime
- Support additional filters (e.g., less than, equal to)
- Return both Order ID and total price in the output
