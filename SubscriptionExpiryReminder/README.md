# Subscription Expiry Reminder
This C# exercise filters a list of users to identify which subscriptions expire within the next 30 days. It's modeled after a real-world system used to send renewal notifications based on date logic.

## Concepts Practiced:
- Lists and loops
- Working with `DateTime` and time comparisons
- Conditional filtering logic
- Returning filtered data from a method
- Console output for result visualization

## Sample Output:
Users with subscriptions expiring in the next 30 days: 0000100003 00005

## Next Steps:
- Make the 30-day threshold dynamic
- Add sorting (soonest expiration first)
- Format the expiration dates in the console output
