# C# Backend Exercises

This repository is a growing collection of practical backend exercises written in C# to sharpen my skills in logic, problem solving, and real-world development workflows.

Each folder contains:
- A focused coding exercise (`Program.cs`)
- A `README.md` explaining the problem, concepts practiced, my rough Input/Process/Output breakdowns before solving the problem and potential extensions

## ‚úÖ Topics Covered So Far:
- Filtering lists with conditionals
- Working with custom object classes
- DateTime comparison logic
- Loops and List handling
- Console output formatting

## üìÅ Folders:
- `PremiumFoodOrders/` ‚Äì Filters expensive orders using threshold logic
- `SubscriptionExpiryReminder/` ‚Äì Identifies users with subscriptions expiring in 30 days
- `VehicleServiceCheck/` ‚Äì Returns vehicles that need servicing based on mileage

## üß± Next Steps:
I‚Äôm continuing to add new exercises and remixes to:
- Practice backend fundamentals
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Build up toward full-stack application development

Feel free to explore, clone, or follow my journey!
